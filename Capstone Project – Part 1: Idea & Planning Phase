Project Idea: Smart Task Manager – A simple web-based task management system where users can create, organize, and track their tasks. The app allows users to assign categories, set deadlines, and update statuses (pending, in-progress, completed). This project focuses on building a functional backend API using Django REST Framework, with clean modular apps and a well-structured database.

Main Features: User Authentication, Task Managment (CRUD), Catagories/Labels, and Task Status & Deadlines

APIs to Use No external API required for core functionality.
